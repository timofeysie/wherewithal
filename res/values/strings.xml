    <string name="instructions_string">This game is based on the card game Hula.  If the game is for 12 words, it would be played as such. \n 1 - Each player has their own deck of 12 words split into 12 text cards and 12 definition cards, 24 cards in total.\n 2 - Shuffle the text and definition cards separately and put the two groups in front of each player. \n 3 - Each player takes 6 text cards and 1 definition card to start. \n 4 - In each round, a player needs to put down one card a discarded card pile. \n 5 - Then they take a new card from either their text or their definition deck.  If a player has two or less cards on their turn, they can pick up two cards on their turn, one reading and one writing.  If there is not enough cards to pick up in the definition or text piles, the discarded piles are shuffled and put underneath any remaining cards. \n 6 - The player then has the option to put down pairs of matching cards.  They put the phone down on each card in turn, making sure to scan the matching pairs in their text-definition or definition-text order. \n 7 - The first pair of matching text-definition cards is worth 1 point.  The second pair will be worth 3.  The next 4.  \n 8 - The next player takes their turn, starting from step 4.</string>
